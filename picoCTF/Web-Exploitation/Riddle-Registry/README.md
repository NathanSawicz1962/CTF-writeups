Professional Write-up: Riddle Registry (picoCTF)
Category: Forensics

Difficulty: Easy

Tools Used: Adobe Acrobat Reader, CyberChef

Objective
The goal was to investigate a "peculiar" PDF file and uncover a hidden flag hidden somewhere within its structure or metadata.

Vulnerability/Concept: Metadata Leakage
This challenge demonstrates Information Disclosure via Metadata. Metadata is "data about data"—it includes information like the author, creation date, and software used. In a penetration test, metadata is a goldmine for attackers because it often reveals usernames, internal file paths, or even passwords that developers forgot to scrub before making a document public.

The Solution
File Acquisition: Downloaded the "Hidden Confidential Document" provided in the challenge description.

Metadata Inspection: Opened the PDF using Adobe Acrobat Reader. I navigated to the document properties to inspect the metadata fields.

Discovery: In the Author field, I found a string of "garbled nonsense" that appeared to be encoded text rather than a standard name.

Decoding: Recognizing the character set (alphanumeric with potential padding), I copied the string into CyberChef.

Extraction: I applied the From Base64 recipe. The decoded output revealed the cleartext flag.

Mitigation (PenTest+ Focus)
To prevent sensitive information from being leaked through documents, organizations should implement the following:

Metadata Scrubbing: Use automated tools (like exiftool or built-in Office/Adobe "Inspect Document" features) to strip all metadata before publishing files externally.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Deploy DLP solutions that scan outgoing attachments for encoded strings or patterns that resemble sensitive data.

Security Awareness Training: Educate staff on the risks of including sensitive details in document properties or "hidden" comments.
